Minimal browser-based videoconferencing client using WebRTC,
MediaStreams, and Peer.js.

Run the demo from https://morgan3d.github.io/misc/jschat/. That URL
will launch the host, which provides the guest URL.


TODO:

- Fix startup sometimes failing. Race condition?
- Audio mute
- Video mute
- Detect drop
- Leave button
- Make an explicit "Join" button so that it doesn't prompt for permissions suddenly on page load
- Nice visual feedback on URL copy
- Text streaming
- How do I connect a third party?
